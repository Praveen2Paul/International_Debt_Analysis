# International_Debt_Analysis
In this Analysis, we analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank to gain insights into the debt situation of developing countries. The dataset includes information on the amount of debt owed by countries across various categories. Through our analysis, we aim to answer questions such as the total amount of debt owed by the countries in the dataset, which country has the highest debt, and the average debt across different debt indicators.__
The dataset contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from  1970 to 2015. [World Bank Data](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/debt/ids/country/CHN)__ 
By connecting to the international_debt database, we can access the relevant table and perform our analysis. This project highlights the importance of understanding and managing international debt for economic development.
